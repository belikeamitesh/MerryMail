## ⚙️ What it does?
MerryMail covers every kind of stuff to make your christmas merry and send beautiful designed cards for your loved ones at a very short time and in a very easy way, we have a different approach for this:

## 🔧 How we built it?

Following key technologies are used to build this web application:
🦾 **Design**
* Figma

🦾 **Frontend**
* Reactjs
* Bootstrap5

🦾 **Backend**
* appwrite
* google api
* Nodejs

🦾 **Database**
* appwrite ( for storing users)

## 🏃 Challenges we ran into
There are many different challenges that we ran into while developing our website:

❌ We used appwrite for the first time . Implemting login logout took a lot of time

❌ Using Google apis for sending mails was again a difficult task we ran into

❌ Designing the app along with designing the figma was the toughest part

## ⭐ Categories we have focused upon

* Best 404 page : We have designed a 404 page along with the UI/UX design of the app

* Best UI/UX Award : We have designed the app focusing on christmas theme on figma

* Best Domain Name from GoDaddy Registry : We bough a domain with an interesting name - MerryMail and we will host the application on this

* Best Use of Appwrite : We have implemented the design using reactjs and appwrite where appwrite is being  used for login logout features.

## 🎯  Future Development

For further development, we plan to:

💥 Host our website using the domain **merrymail.co**, which we have bought from godaddy.com.

💥 A user database to store all the info for future use.

💥 More design for more better cards and user experience for making a card.
